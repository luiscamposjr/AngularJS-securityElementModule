  Here I developed this AngularJS Directive to manage if some element must be rendered or not according to the roles of the user. 
  I'm not showing here a complete solution about ROLES management. If you want to see my solution just go to cbfm-spring-angular
  repository to see the complete solution using Java and Spring-security as back-end.
  
  Example: 
  ```
  <li securityElementDirective="{ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER}">
  	Some element from menu
  </li>
  ```
  
  If you want, text me or create an Issue!
